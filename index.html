          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.</p>
    
          <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
    
          <code>
              for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {<br>
                // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.{<br>
                console.log('Walking east one step');{<br>
              }
          </code>
    
          <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>
    
          <h4>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</h4>
          <!--
          <ul>
            <li>for statement</li>
            <li>do...while statement</li>
            <li>while statement</li>
            <li>labeled statement</li>

        <!-- For Statement -->
        <section class="main-section">
            <h2 class="sec-header">for statement</h2>
            <p>A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop. A for statement looks as follows:</p>
            <p class="loop_form">
                for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression])</br>
                  statement
              </p>
            <p>When a for loop executes, the following occurs:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.</li>
              <li>e condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false, the for loop terminates. If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.</li>
              <li>The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</li>
              <li>If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.</li>
              <li>Control returns to step 2.</li>
            </ol>
      
            <div class="sec-ex">
              <h5 >Example</h5>
              <p>The following function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected options in a scrolling list (a <select> element that allows multiple selections). The for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to zero. It checks that i is less than the number of options in the <select> element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by one after each pass through the loop.</p>
      
              <code>
                function howMany(selectObject) {<br>
                  let numberSelected = 0;<br>
                  for (let i = 0; i < selectObject.options.length; i++) {<br>
                    if (selectObject.options[i].selected) {<br>
                      numberSelected++;<br>
                    }<br>
                  }<br>
                  return numberSelected;<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                let btn = document.getElementById('btn');<br>
                btn.addEventListener('click', function() {<br>
                  alert('Number of options selected: ' + howMany<br>(document.selectForm.musicTypes));<br>
                });
              </code>
      
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- While do statement -->
        <section class="main-section">
            <h2 id="do...while_statement" class="sec-header">do...while statement</h2>
            <p>The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. A do...while statement looks as follows:</p>
            <p class="loop_form">
                do<br>
                statement
              while (condition);
            </p>
            <p>statement is always executed once before the condition is checked (and then again until the while condition returns false). To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements. If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false, execution stops and control passes to the statement following do...while.</p>

            <div class="sec-ex">
              <h5>Example</h5>
              <p>In the following example, the do loop iterates at least once and reiterates until i is no longer less than 5.</p>
              <code>
                  let i = 0;<br>
                  do {<br>
                    i += 1;<br>
                    console.log(i);<br>
                  } while (i < 5);<br>
              </code>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- while statement -->
        <section class="main-section">
            <h2 id="While_do_statement" class="sec-header">While do statement</h2>

            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>

            <p class="loop-form">
                while (condition)<br>
                statement
            </p>

            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>

            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>

            <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>

            <div class="sec-ex">
              <h5>Example</h5>
              <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
              <code>
                  let n = 0;<br>
                  let x = 0;<br>
                  while (n < 3) {<br>
                    n++;<br>
                    x += n;<br>
                  }
              </code>
              <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
              </ul>

              <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sec-ex">
              <h5>Example 2</h5>
              <p>Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes false; otherwise, the loop will never terminate. The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false:</p>
              <code>
                  while (true) {<br>
                    console.log('Hello, world!');<br>
                  }
              </code>
            </div>

        </section>

        <!-- labeled statemen -->
        <section class="main-section">  
          <h2 id="labeled_statement" class="sec-header">labeled statement</h2>

          <p>A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.</p>

          <p>The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following:</p>

          <p class="loop-form">
              label :<br>
              statement
          </p>

          <p>The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be any statement.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="sec-ex">
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>In this example, the label markLoop identifies a while loop.</p>
          <code>
              markLoop:<br>
              while (theMark == true) {<br>
                 doSomething();<br>
              }
          </code>
